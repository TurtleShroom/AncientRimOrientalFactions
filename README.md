Ancient Rim is a mod series that expands the cultural and technoligial timeline beyond the vanilla neolithic, industrial and spacer stages.
The Oriental Factions mod populates RimWorld with factions that use the gear addet by Ancient Rim - Oriental/Desert Edition. Because there is just Egyptian equipment right now here is only an Egyptian faction.
